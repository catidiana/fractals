# A program to create and draw flame fractals
To read more about flaming fractals check this wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame
<br>Flame fractal is formed by the set of random affine transformations and one non-linear transformation</br>
You can select one of 22 non-linear transformations. Note, that you don't have any control on affine set and it's colors, but you can change it's size.

On the bottom panel you can see amount of affine tramsformations. You can increase\decrease it using [ ] buttons, or generate new one, to have more fun! Just press 0.
<br>Note that you can experience some delay before the program start to draw. It happens because we need some additional calculations for the set.</br>
Initial picture you see is very noisy - to remove this noise press Backspace key. You can also regulate brightness of your image with / key

Here is some samples you can get, using different non-linear transformations. "Random" select 2 random transformations and mix them in random proportions, which can give you very interesting results.
