# A program to create and draw fractals
<br>In the master branch you'll find a source code for the program to draw Julia fractals.<br/>
Check the 'flame' branch to get even more - program that draws Flame fractals!
<br> To get more information about Julia frantals read this article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set</br>
To read about flaming fractals check this wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame
<br><br/>
In this branch we discuss Julia fractals only. Switch the branch to discover flame fractals.

<br> The program draws fractal in a real time, on the bottom panel you can see the current iteration step N.</br>
Another information you see there is the constant parameter C in equation f(z) = z^2 + C. (we use quadratic polynomials only). Also you see the current scale and color scheme.
<br>You can easily change these parameters with the keyboard control and instructions in the right panel.
